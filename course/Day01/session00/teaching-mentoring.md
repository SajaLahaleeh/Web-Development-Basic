# Mentoring vs Teaching

### There is some question today on what educational methodology is best for learning—teaching or mentoring?

## ✧ TEACHING IS ABOUT KNOWLEDGE

A teacher is someone who provides knowledge, lessons, rules and information. Teachers are people who influence you in ways that can only be obtained from knowledge, books and memorization and the like.

## ✧ MENTORING IS ABOUT EXPERIENCE

A mentor is someone who provides those life lessons from experience, guides you with each step and sees you through no matter what. For example, my husband was a pilot.

**TEACHING FOCUSES ON THE HOW, MENTORING FOCUSES ON THE WHY.**

## Which one is right for me?

Teachers can be mentors and mentors can be teachers. Both have an important and necessary place in education.

A teacher’s first priority may be instruction—but they can be creative and interactive in their approach. They recognize and foster individuality, creativity and become mentors in their own right.

And while a mentor’s priority is on personal development, the mentee must possess “know-how” skills. And so mentoring will always have an instructional component.

**```So as a student, do you need a teacher or a mentor? The answer is…you need both.```**

## 3 differences between a teacher and mentor.
**1. Mentorship is based on building a relationship between mentor and mentee.**

**2. A mentor guides you. A teacher teaches.**

**3. Mentorship is more holistic, complex and based on fulfilling a vision.**
