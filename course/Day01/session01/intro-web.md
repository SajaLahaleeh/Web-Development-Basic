# Introduction To Web Development

## First, What is the World Wide Web and the Internet?

**Are the internet and the world wide web are the same things?**

**The answer is: NO!**

The internet is a huge network of computers all connected together. The world wide web ('www' or 'web' for short) is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers. **Your web browser uses the internet to access the web**.

### What is the Internet?

the internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite to communicate between networks and devices.

It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), and file sharing.

### What is the Web?

In 1989 the world wide web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was trying to find a new way for scientists to easily share the data from their experiments.

The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.

The purpose of a website can be almost anything: a news platform, an advertisement, an online library, a forum for sharing images, or an educational.

Once you are connected to the Internet, you can access and view websites using a type of application called a web browser. Just keep in mind that the web browser itself is not the Internet; it only displays websites that are stored on the Internet.

## What Do Web Developer Do?

Web developers build websites and ensure they perform reliably and efficiently.
A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s performance and capacity.

### Types of web developers

Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers.

- **Back-end** web developers create the website’s structure, write code, and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a website’s content.

- **Front-end** web developers work on the visual part of the website—the pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout of each page, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site.

- **Full-stack** developers do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team.
