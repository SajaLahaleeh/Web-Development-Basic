## What HTML5?

HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages.

### Semantics

**"Semantic HTML"** refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of your content--not its appearance. There's a whole set of elements designed for the sole purpose of adding more meaning to the overall layout of a web page. They're called "sectioning elements", and they look something like this:

Using these as an alternative to `<div>` elements is an important aspect of modern web development because it makes it:

- easier for search engines, screen readers, and other machines to identify the different parts of your website.
- also helps you as a developer keep your site organized, which, in turn, makes it easier to maintain.

### What are the semantic tags that HTML5 brought us?

|   **Tag**   | **Description**                                                        |

| `<header>`  | Specifies a header for a document or section                           |
| `<section>` | Defines a section in a document                                        |
|   `<nav>`   | Defines navigation links                                               |
